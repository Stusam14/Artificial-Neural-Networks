## FeedForward Neural Network

A feedforward neural network for reading and predicting data from the MNIST library of images , the neural network is trained to predict the type of number that it is shown and it can make a prediction of what kind of a number it is.

## Neural Network file
This file contains methods from the pytorch library to allow for the creation of the neural network , the is the first phase that the data goes through , which is the forward pass , then the second one which is backpropagation which uses a technique called gradient descent to reduce the loss (cost) and further improving the learning of the ANN.

## Installation
- provide your own data set or change the DATA_DIR to download and set download to true for train data
- Once the data is trained you can put in a jpegs of your choice from MNIST.

## Run commnads

to run : python classifier.py
